# MyCompiler

MyCompiler is a simplified Pascal compiler designed for educational purposes. It implements basic features of the Pascal programming language, including lexical analysis, parsing, and semantic analysis.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **src/main.cpp**: The entry point of the compiler. It initializes the tokenizer and parser, processes the input file, and manages the compilation workflow.
  
- **src/parser.hpp**: Defines the `Parser` class responsible for parsing the tokens generated by the tokenizer. It includes methods for parsing various constructs of the Pascal language, such as programs, variable declarations, and expressions.
  
- **src/tokenization.hpp**: Defines the `Tokenizer` class responsible for lexical analysis. It tokenizes the input source code into a series of tokens, identifying keywords, identifiers, literals, and symbols.
  
- **src/semantic_analyzer.cpp**: Implements the `SemanticAnalyzer` class. It performs semantic analysis on the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by the parser, checking for variable declarations, type mismatches, and other semantic errors.
  
- **src/semantic_analyzer.hpp**: Declares the `SemanticAnalyzer` class and its methods. It includes methods for analyzing declarations and types, as well as utility functions for retrieving variable types and expression types.
  
- **src/ast.hpp**: Defines the structure of the abstract syntax tree (AST). It includes definitions for various node types, such as variable declarations, assignments, and expressions, which are used by the parser and semantic analyzer.
  
- **CMakeLists.txt**: The configuration file for CMake, specifying the build instructions for the project, including source files, compiler options, and dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
4. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```

## Usage

To compile a Pascal source file, run the compiled executable with the source file as an argument:
```
./MyCompiler <source_file.pas>
```

## Features

- Lexical analysis to tokenize Pascal source code.
- Parsing of Pascal constructs to build an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- Semantic analysis to check for variable declarations and type mismatches.
- Support for basic Pascal syntax and constructs.
